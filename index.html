        <p>
            Drinking coffee was consistently associated with a lower risk of death from all causes and from heart
            disease, with the largest reduction in relative risk of death at three cups a day, compared with non-coffee
            drinkers. Increasing consumption to above three cups a day was not associated with harm, but the beneficial
            effect was less pronounced.
            Coffee was also associated with a lower risk of several cancers, including prostate, endometrial, skin and
            liver cancer, as well as type 2 diabetes, gallstones and gout. The greatest benefit was seen for liver
            conditions, such as cirrhosis of the liver.

    <h3>Types</h3>
    <div class="intro">
        <p>
            The beans we roast, grind, and brew to make coffee are the seeds of a fruit. The coffee plant produces
            coffee cherries, and the beans are the seeds inside.

            Coffee trees can naturally grow to over 30 ft/9 m. But producers prune and stump plants short to conserve
            the plants’ energy and to help harvesting. Smaller trees have better yield and quality in a limited space.

            Each tree is covered with green, waxy leaves that grow in pairs and coffee cherries grow along its branches.
            Depending on the variety, it takes three to four years for a coffee plant to produce fruit. The National
            Coffee Association USA states that the average coffee tree produces 10 lbs of coffee cherry per year, which
            results in around 2 lbs of green beans.

            But there are different varieties of coffee and their beans have many different characteristics. Size,
            flavor, and disease resistance vary, among other factors. <br><i>
                There are four primary types of coffee beans:Arabica (Coffee arabica), Robusta (Coffee caniphora),
                Liberica (Coffee liberica), and Excelsa (Coffee liberica var. dewevrei).

        <div class="Brands B2">
            <h2 class="brandname">1. STARBUCKS</h2>
            <p class="cofbrand">The brand is not known for sourcing and roasting the best coffee beans. Most of their
                coffee beans are dark roasted, meaning, they taste bitter. And many consumers, who know their coffee,
                complain that Starbucks coffee has a distinct burnt taste.Plus, Starbucks gives you a lot of options to
                choose from. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="Brands B3">
            <h2 class="brandname">2. DUNKIN DOUGHNUTS</h2>
            <p class="cofbrand">Dunkin' is not as big a brand as Starbucks but they are second in line in the number of
                stores. But yes, the coffee Dunkin' offers is surely somewhat superior to Starbucks. For instance,
                Dunkin' does not have the signature burnt taste in coffee as Starbucks does. The coffee is also cheaper.

        <div class="Brands B6">
            <h2 class="brandname">3. Mc CAFE</h2>
            <p class="cofbrand">Owned by McDonald's, McCafe is one of the leading coffee chains in countries like
                Australia and New Zealand. McCafé enjoys the benefit of having a vast presence (Because let's face it,
                McDonald's is everywhere!) As McDonald's expands worldwide, there is a decent chance of McCafé doing the
                same.</p>
